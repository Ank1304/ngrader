A programming judge web application using Judge0 API.

> In the beginning, we created nGrader with the intention of learning to develop a web application. Therefore, the project was poorly structured and the code was too hard to understand. In version 2, we have restructured the whole project and frameworks will be used. The code would be more readable and easy to use!
